          <p>CAIRIS (Computer Aided Integration of Requirements and Information Security) is a Requirements Management tool for specifying secure and usable systems. CAIRIS was built from the ground-up to support the elements necessary for usability, requirements, and risk analysis. CAIRIS features include: </p>

<ul>
<li>Support for KAOS goal and obstacle modelling, and traceability between goal, requirements, security, and usability model elements. </li>
<li>Support for entering and managing usability data, such as personas, tasks, and use cases </li>
<li>Support for entering and managing risk analysis data.</li>
<li>Support for specifying attack patterns to reason about potential attacks.</li>
<li>The ability to import architectural patterns to automatically derive attack surface metrics based on them.</li>
<li>Automatic visualisation of models, and quantitative/quantative scoring of security and usability data </li>
<li>Automatic document generation of a VOLERE compliant requirements specification.</li>
</ul>

<p>== Getting Started ==</p>

<p>CAIRIS should run on most recent flavours of Linux.  The dependencies that need to be pre-installed are described in the manual.
Sadly, the manual itself is a little out-of-date but, from our experience, people who understand the concepts used by the tool can usally get up and running pretty quickly.</p>

<p>== Get in Touch ==</p>

<p>If you get any problems running CAIRIS, or have any questions or feature requests then please do get in touch.</p>
