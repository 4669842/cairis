CAIRIS (Computer Aided Integration of Requirements and Information Security) is a Requirements Management tool for specifying secure and usable systems. CAIRIS was built from the ground-up to support the elements necessary for usability, requirements, and risk analysis. CAIRIS features include: 

* Support for KAOS goal and obstacle modelling, and traceability between goal, requirements, security, and usability model elements. 
* Support for entering and managing usability data, such as personas, tasks, and use cases 
* Support for entering and managing risk analysis data.
* Support for specifying attack patterns to reason about potential attacks.
* The ability to import architectural patterns to automatically derive attack surface metrics based on them.
* Automatic visualisation of models, and quantitative/quantative scoring of security and usability data 
* Automatic document generation of a VOLERE compliant requirements specification.

CAIRIS should run on any platform that its open source dependencies run on.  This includes most flavours of Linux.
