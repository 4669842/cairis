CAIRIS (Computer Aided Integration of Requirements and Information Security) is a Requirements Management tool for specifying secure and usable systems. CAIRIS was built from the ground-up to support the elements necessary for usability, requirements, and risk analysis. CAIRIS features include: 

* Automatic visualisation of models -- including KAOS goal and obstacle models -- and traceability between goal, requirements, security, and usability model elements
