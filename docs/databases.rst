CAIRIS databases
======================

Default database
----------------

Each CAIRIS account comes with an *<account>_default* database.  If you or your team are using CAIRIS to work on a single project at any given time then you shouldn't need to worry about additional databases if you are using the same account.


Using other databases
---------------------

There might be times when it might be helpful to setup multiple databases.  For example, the live demo on https//demo.cairis.org has two exemplar databases that people can interact with to see different examples of CAIRIS projects.

To create a new database, select the System/New Database menu, and enter the name for a new database.  After a few moments, a new database will be created and your CAIRIS application will point to this database.

To open another database, select the System/Open Database menu, and select the name of an existing database.  After a few moments, your CAIRIS application will point to the chosen database.

You can delete a database by selecting the System/Delete Database option, and selecting the name of the database you want to remove.  You cannot delete the database you currently have open.

To empty the contents of any database, select the System/Clear Database menu.
