Dependencies
============

CAIRIS supports the modelling of strategic dependencies between roles, where these *dependees* depend on *dependers* for a dependum (goals, assets, or tasks).

Adding, updating, and deleting a dependency
-------------------------------------------

   -  Select the Requirements/Dependencies menu to open the Dependencies table, and click on the Add button to open the Dependency form.

   -  Select the Environment, Depender and Dependee roles, the type of dependency, and the dependency itself.

   -  Click on the Rationale folder, and specify some rationale for the dependency's existence.

   -  Click on the Create button to add the new dependency.

   -  Existing dependency can be modified by clicking on the dependency in the Dependencies table, making the necessary changes, and clicking on the Update button.

   -  To delete a dependency, click the Delete button next to the dependency to be removed in the Dependencies table.


Viewing dependencies
--------------------

Dependencies can be viewed by Responsibility models by clicking on the Models/Responsibility menu, and selecting the environment to view the environment for.

Dependencies are indicated by the rounded arrows that flow from the depender to the dependee through the dependum.
