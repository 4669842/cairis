Starting CAIRIS
===============

You can use CAIRIS on most web browsers, although there are some compatibility problems when working with requirements in Firefox.

To start using CAIRIS, visit the site hosting CAIRIS services, e.g. http://demo.cairis.org, and authenticate using the credentials provided.  For example, on http://demo.cairis.org, you can login with the username / password of test / test.

Once you login in you should see the home screen.
