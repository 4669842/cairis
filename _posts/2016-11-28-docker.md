## The CAIRIS Docker container ##

We're pleased to announce that a CAIRIS web app container is now available for download from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/explore/).  You can find the container [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/shamalfaily/cairis/).


## What is Docker? ##

[Docker](https://www.docker.com) is a platform that allows you to run *containerised* applications.  In the case of CAIRIS, downloading and running the CAIRIS container means that all you need to do is point your web browser to the appropriate URL exposed by the container and you're ready to go.

## Two words of warning before you start ##

* The container is based on the latest version of CAIRIS on github at the time that the container was built and uploaded.  As such, there may be fixes on github that haven't been incorporated into the version of the CAIRIS web app on Docker.

* This container is not for operational use.  The container makes lavish use of default credentials, and uses Flask's built-in Werkzeug server, which scales poorly and doesn't support multiple requests at the same time.  The team is evaluating more robust deployment options, so look forward to incremental improvements towards a production-ready container for general use.

## Bugs / Requests / Suggestions ##

As always we welcome your feedback.  Please raise an [issue](https://github.com/failys/cairis/issues) if you find any problems or have specific features/suggestions you would like to see incorporated.
