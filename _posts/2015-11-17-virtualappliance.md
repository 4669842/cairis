## CAIRIS: now available as a virtual appliance ##

Although following the installation instructions for CAIRIS isn't too difficult, it does require a certain amount of time and motivation to setup a suitable Linux environment.  For those people that just want to get going with CAIRIS as quickly as possible, we've made a pre-built Ubuntu virtual machine disk available for [download](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bx5c5XNaOMoTM1RsclRjYTVSSGs).

You can find more information about creating a VM from the virtual machine disk on the [Getting Started page]({{ site.baseurl }}/install.html).  On the VM has been created, all you need to do is login as *cairis* (password is the same as the username), and startup CAIRIS directly from the launcher.
