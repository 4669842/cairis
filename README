# CAIRIS 

CAIRIS (Computer Aided Integration of Requirements and Information Security) is a design tool for specifying and modelling secure and usable systems. CAIRIS was built from the ground-up to support the elements necessary for usability, requirements, and risk analysis. 

See [the CAIRIS website](http://cairis.org) for more information on the tool, and details on how to get started.
