{"name":"CAIRIS","tagline":"Computer Aided Integration of Requirements and Information Security","body":"CAIRIS (Computer Aided Integration of Requirements and Information Security) is a Requirements Management tool for specifying secure and usable systems. CAIRIS was built from the ground-up to support the elements necessary for usability, requirements, and risk analysis. CAIRIS features include: \r\n\r\n* Support for KAOS goal and obstacle modelling, and traceability between goal, requirements, security, and usability model elements. \r\n* Support for entering and managing usability data, such as personas, tasks, and use cases \r\n* Support for entering and managing risk analysis data.\r\n* Support for specifying attack patterns to reason about potential attacks.\r\n* The ability to import architectural patterns to automatically derive attack surface metrics based on them.\r\n* Automatic visualisation of models, and quantitative/quantative scoring of security and usability data \r\n* Automatic document generation of a VOLERE compliant requirements specification.\r\n\r\n== Getting Started ==\r\n\r\nCAIRIS should run on most recent flavours of Linux.  The dependencies that need to be pre-installed are described in the manual.\r\nSadly, the manual itself is a little out-of-date but, from our experience, people who understand the concepts used by the tool can usally get up and running pretty quickly.\r\n\r\n\r\n== Get in Touch ==\r\n\r\nIf you get any problems running CAIRIS, or have any questions or feature requests then please do get in touch.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
