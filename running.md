title: Running CAIRIS
---

To start CAIRIS, you can open a terminal window and go to the directory containing the source code of CAIRIS.  This is usually `$CAIRIS_DIR/cairis`.

        $ python cairis.py

If this is the first time CAIRIS has been run and the CAIRIS database is empty, CAIRIS should like [fig:initStartup].

![fig:initStartup]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/CAIRIS_new.jpg "An empty CAIRIS project")

This main CAIRIS window is split in 2 halves.  The bottom half is the taken up the requirements editor.
The top half of the screen is taken up by the menu and tool-bar buttons.
